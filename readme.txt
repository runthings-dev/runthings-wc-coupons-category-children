Restrict WooCommerce coupons by product categories, automatically including all child/descendant categories.

== Description ==

Coupons Category Children for WooCommerce extends the built-in WooCommerce coupon category restrictions by automatically including all subcategories when you select a parent category.

With WooCommerce's default category restrictions, if you select "Clothing" as an allowed category, only products directly in "Clothing" will qualify - not products in "T-Shirts" or "Pants" subcategories. This plugin solves that limitation.

= Features =

* Restrict coupons to specific category trees (parent + all descendants)
* Exclude entire category trees from coupon eligibility
* Automatic subcategory inclusion - no need to manually select every child category
* Works alongside WooCommerce's existing coupon restrictions
* Customizable error messages via filter

= How It Works =

When you select a category in the "Allowed categories (incl. children)" field, the plugin automatically includes all subcategories during validation. If your category structure changes over time, the coupon restrictions update automatically.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/runthings-wc-coupons-category-children` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to Marketing > Coupons and edit or create a coupon.
4. In the "Usage restriction" tab, you will see the new category fields with "(incl. children)" labels.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this differ from WooCommerce's built-in category restrictions? =

WooCommerce's built-in "Product categories" field only matches products directly assigned to the selected categories. This plugin's fields automatically include all subcategories of your selection.

= Can I use both this plugin's fields and WooCommerce's built-in category fields? =

Yes, but they operate as separate restrictions (AND logic). If you use both, a coupon must pass both sets of rules. For simplicity, we recommend using one or the other on a given coupon.

= What happens if I add new subcategories later? =

They are automatically included! The plugin checks category relationships at validation time, so new subcategories are picked up immediately.
