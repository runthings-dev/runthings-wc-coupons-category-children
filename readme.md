# Coupons Category Children for WooCommerce

Restrict WooCommerce coupons by product categories, automatically including all child/descendant categories.

## Description

Coupons Category Children for WooCommerce extends the built-in WooCommerce coupon category restrictions in two ways:

**Easier category selection:** Select a parent category and all its subcategories are automatically included. With WooCommerce's default restrictions, selecting "Clothing" only matches products directly in that category - not products in "T-Shirts" or "Trousers" subcategories. This plugin includes the entire category tree.

**Future-proof coupons:** With default WooCommerce, if you add or reorganize subcategories, you must manually update every active coupon to include the new categories. This plugin stores the parent category selection and dynamically expands it at validation time - new subcategories are automatically included without editing existing coupons.

## Features

* Restrict coupons to specific category trees (parent + all descendants)
* Exclude entire category trees from coupon eligibility
* Automatic subcategory inclusion - no need to manually select every child category
* Works alongside WooCommerce's existing coupon restrictions
* Customizable error messages via filter
* AutomateWoo compatibility - category restrictions are copied when generating coupons from templates

## How It Works

When you select a category in the "Product categories (incl. children)" field, the plugin automatically includes all subcategories during validation. If your category structure changes over time, the coupon restrictions update automatically.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/runthings-wc-coupons-category-children` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to Marketing > Coupons and edit or create a coupon.
4. In the "Usage restriction" tab, you will see the new category fields with "(incl. children)" labels.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does this differ from WooCommerce's built-in category restrictions?

WooCommerce's built-in "Product categories" field only matches products directly assigned to the selected categories. This plugin's fields automatically include all subcategories of your selection.

### Can I use both this plugin's fields and WooCommerce's built-in category fields?

Not really. The built-in category check runs before custom plugin checks. They operate as separate restrictions (AND logic). If you use both, a coupon must first pass the built-in category rules, which isn't likely to contain the child categories.

For simplicity, we recommend using one or the other on a given coupon.

If you find that this is a blocking issue, please open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/runthings-dev/runthings-wc-coupons-category-children/issues). Allowing per-category selection of "include children" or "only top-level" is on the potential features roadmap.

### What happens if I add new subcategories later?

They are automatically included! The plugin checks category relationships at validation time, so new subcategories are picked up immediately.

### Does this work with AutomateWoo?

Yes! When AutomateWoo generates coupons from a template coupon, the category restrictions are automatically copied to the generated coupon.
